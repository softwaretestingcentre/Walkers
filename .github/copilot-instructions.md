This project is a Vite React app for recording and saving editable minutes from meetings. The main page should have 9 sections, each corresponding to a bullet point from the 'Suggested Initial Work' section. Each section should have an editable text area and a save button. Use localStorage for persistence. Style the app for clarity and usability.
