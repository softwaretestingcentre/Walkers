    title: "Appraisal in a Group Session",
    content: [
      "In each session, opportunities to appraise yourself and the group work arise.",
      "This is not like the ubiquitous 'approval ratings' that are everywhere at present, but rather like listening to the balance of work together as the voice of the spirit wind that sweeps over everything, to gives us breath and inspiration, to clarify and clean what is muddled, and to open a space where we note what has changed, what needs changing, what is in process.",
      "Following this metaphor through the elements, how was the work?",
      "What was warm and supportive? What was uncomfortable or oppressive?",
      "What flowed? What felt stuck, unresolved? What needs cleaning out?",
      "What felt solid and embodied? What didn't quite come together?",
      "What was inspired? What was unclear? What needs a clearer blueprint?",
      "What was experienced? What changed? What is currently rippling out?",
      "The Three Candles of Spirit: In appraisal, we are sensitive to each other, holding the circle as a sacred meeting where ‘the three candles that illumine every darkness: truth, nature and knowledge' can burn freely in everyone's soul cauldrons: reminding us of the needs and requirements of All That Is that we each experience:",
      "Coire Gorias/Cauldron of Warming: our instinct, stability, nourishment, warmth, health, belonging to the physical world with other beings. NATURE.",
      "Coire Ernmae /Cauldron of Vocation: our intuition, gifts, emotional support, exchanges, flexibility, integrity, belonging to the world of ancestors. TRUTH.",
      "Coire Sois/ Cauldron of Knowledge: our insight, understanding, spiritual poise, beliefs, ideas, concepts, belonging to the world of spirit. KNOWLEDGE.",
      "Shamanic Balance and Neutrality: Appraisal is not about expecting perfection, nor an opportunity to criticize yourself or others: it is about shamanic balance and shamanic neutrality: the way our work changes the universe into more harmonious lines, and the way we can get out of the way of ourselves to allow spirit to make those changes. Learning those two things is everything in this work.  We each remain the ‘journey wrangler.'"
