# NOTES FOR PEER REVIEW GROUPS AUGUST 2025

## Suggested Initial Work: 
Your peer review group is for you to shape together. Topics will arise to work with. To get started, these are a few suggestions.

0. Because online-work is happening in your home, separately, makes it no less sacred. Find ways to hallow the meeting: how you make your circle, how you open and close it, what is invited and thanked. Note what you need as a group to come together in a sacred way, and what modifications you need. (e.g. Singing together is difficult because it becomes distorted: so the one leading the singing is heard, everyone else mutes and sings the same.)
1. Sharing your background and current motivations, so that you can better attune to each other, creating aims for work that support everyone. Different people can lead, send out links for meeting up etc.
2. Journey on creating a mutual code of ethics, and agree on a method of working together e.g. timings that are helpful, preparation needed, etc.
3. While most members of our Peer Review came in via the Foundation Course and have a clan, others came in via personal sessions with Caitlín or Margot: journey together to find the animal/spirit who holds your circle in their care.
4. Journeying as a group and in pairs on your chosen topic. Journeying as individuals who feedback.
5. Does your online milieu have a spatial identity? Journey together to understand what kind of spirit place it is: it is still there when you are not meeting together and can be visited.
6. One person to take responsibility of secretary for each session with an understudy, to record a brief précis of work, to be shared by all. Swop roles regularly, so one person is not responsible everytime and  becomes swamped.
7. Each session to have time for appraisal of work or your agenda at the end of the session. See below.
8. Set clear aims, dates, and times for next session.





## Issues that may arise in / topics that may be chosen for peer-review work:

## APPRAISAL IN A GROUP SESSION

In each session, opportunities to appraise yourself and the group work arise.
This is not like the ubiquitous ‘approval ratings’ that are everywhere at present, but rather like listening to the balance of work together as the voice of the spirit wind that sweeps over everything, to gives us breath and inspiration, to clarify and clean what is muddled, and to open a space where we note what has changed, what needs changing, what is in process.

### Following this metaphor through the elements, how was the work?
What was warm and supportive? What was uncomfortable or oppressive?
What flowed? What felt stuck, unresolved? What needs cleaning out?
What felt solid and embodied? What didn’t quite come together?
What was inspired? What was unclear? What needs a clearer blueprint?
What was experienced? What changed? What is currently rippling out?

### The Three Candles of Spirit
In appraisal, we are sensitive to each other, holding the circle as a sacred meeting where ‘the three candles that illumine every darkness: truth, nature and knowledge’ can burn freely in everyone’s soul cauldrons: reminding us of the needs and requirements of All That Is that we each experience:

### Coire Gorias/Cauldron of Warming: 
our instinct, stability, nourishment, warmth, health, belonging to the physical world with other beings. NATURE.

### Coire Ernmae /Cauldron of Vocation: 
our intuition, gifts, emotional support, exchanges, flexibility, integrity, belonging to the world of ancestors. TRUTH.

### Coire Sois/ Cauldron of Knowledge:  
our insight, understanding, spiritual poise, beliefs, ideas, concepts, belonging to the world of spirit. KNOWLEDGE.

### Shamanic Balance and Neutrality
Appraisal is not about expecting perfection, nor an opportunity to criticize yourself or others: it is about shamanic balance and shamanic neutrality: the way our work changes the universe into more harmonious lines, and the way we can get out of the way of ourselves to allow spirit to make those changes. Learning those two things is everything in this work.  We each remain the ‘journey wrangler.’
