Feature: Meeting notes app extended functionality

  # Section CRUD and validation
  @regression
  Scenario Outline: User saves and loads notes in a section
    Given Walker is viewing the meeting notes for date "<date>"
    When Walker enters <input> in the <section> section
    And Walker clicks the "Save" button for the <section> section
    Then the notes in the <section> section should be <expected> after reload
    Examples:
      | date        | section                 | input                  | expected                |
      | 2025-10-05  | Hallowing the Meeting   | "Some updated notes"   | "Some updated notes"    |
      | 2025-10-04  | Hallowing the Meeting   | "ðŸ˜€âœ¨æ¼¢å­—"              | "ðŸ˜€âœ¨æ¼¢å­—"               |
      | 2025-10-04  | Hallowing the Meeting   | "<script>alert('x')</script>" | "<script>alert('x')</script>" |

  Scenario Outline: User cannot save invalid notes
    Given Walker is viewing the meeting notes for date "<date>"
    When Walker enters <input> in the <section> section
    And Walker clicks the "Save" button for the <section> section
    Then an error message should be shown for the <section> section
    Examples:
      | date        | section                 | input         |
      | 2025-10-04  | Hallowing the Meeting   | ""            |
      | 2025-10-04  | Hallowing the Meeting   | whitespace    |

  Scenario: User sees all meeting sections
    Given Walker is on the main page
    Then Walker should see all meeting sections with headings, editable text areas, and a Save button for each

  Scenario: User views notes for a different date
    Given Walker is viewing the meeting notes for date "2025-09-26"
    When Walker selects the date "2025-08-09"
    Then the notes for date "2025-08-09" should be displayed in all sections

  Scenario: Notes are loaded from localStorage
    Given Walker has previously saved notes for date "2025-09-21"
    When Walker selects the date "2025-09-21"
    Then the notes for date "2025-09-21" should be loaded from localStorage and displayed

  Scenario: User deletes all notes for a date
    Given Walker is viewing the meeting notes for date "2025-10-04"
    When Walker clears all sections and clicks Save for each section
    Then all notes for date "2025-10-04" should be empty after reload

  # UI and panel behaviour
  @Performance
  Scenario: Peer Review Model panel expands and collapses
    Given Walker is on the main page
    When Walker toggles the "Peer-Review Model for Groups" panel
    Then the "Peer-Review Model for Groups" panel should be expanded
    When Walker toggles the "Peer-Review Model for Groups" panel
    Then the "Peer-Review Model for Groups" panel should be collapsed

  # Batch save
  @regression @save-all
  Scenario: Save the entire form
    Given Walker is viewing the meeting notes for date "2025-10-04"
    When Walker enters "Agenda updated" in the "Agenda" section
    And Walker enters "Decisions recorded" in the "Decisions" section
    And Walker clicks the "Save Entire Form" button
    Then both the "Agenda" section and the "Decisions" section contain their respective saved text
    # Action: verify batch save persists all sections atomically

  # Autosave
  @regression @autosave
  Scenario: Autosave triggers after inactivity
    Given Walker is viewing the meeting notes for date "2025-10-04"
    When Walker types "Draft note" in the "Hallowing the Meeting" section and is idle for 3 seconds
    Then the app autosaves the draft for the "Hallowing the Meeting" section
    # Behaviour: autosave interval should be non-intrusive and recoverable

  # Concurrency
  @regression @concurrency
  Scenario: Concurrent edits from two tabs - last write wins
    Given Walker opens the notes for date "2025-10-04" in two separate tabs
    When In tab A Walker enters "Note from A" in the "Hallowing the Meeting" section and saves
    And In tab B Walker enters "Note from B" in the "Hallowing the Meeting" section and saves
    Then the app shows the content from the last saved tab as authoritative
    # Concurrency: document expected behaviour is last-write-wins; note if app implements merge

  # Offline edit
  @regression @offline-edit
  Scenario: Edit offline and sync when back online
    Given Walker opens the app and goes offline
    When Walker edits the "Hallowing the Meeting" section to "Offline edit" and clicks save
    And Walker returns online
    Then the app synchronises the offline edits to the server
    # Edge case: conflict resolution and user notification on sync

  # Export/import
  @regression @export-import
  Scenario: Export and import notes as JSON
    Given Walker is viewing the meeting notes for date "2025-10-04"
    When Walker clicks the "Export JSON" button
    Then a downloadable JSON file is created containing the current notes
    When Walker clears the form and then imports the previously exported JSON
    Then the form is restored from the imported JSON
    # Feature: export/import is useful for backups and migrations

  # Accessibility
  @regression @a11y
  Scenario: Keyboard accessibility for save controls
    Given Walker focuses the "Hallowing the Meeting" section textarea
    When Walker presses the keyboard shortcut to save (e.g., Ctrl+S)
    Then the app saves the focused section
    # Accessibility: keyboard-only users must be able to save without mouse

  # Security
  @regression @xss
  Scenario: Prevent XSS in saved notes
    Given Walker is viewing the meeting notes for date "2025-10-04"
    When Walker enters "<script>alert('x')</script>" in the "Hallowing the Meeting" section
    And Walker clicks the "Save" button for the "Hallowing the Meeting" section
    Then the app stores the content but does not execute embedded scripts when displayed
    # Security: ensure saved content is escaped or sanitised when rendered

  # Performance
  @regression @large-note
  Scenario: Handle very large notes gracefully
    Given Walker is viewing the meeting notes for date "2025-10-04"
    When Walker pastes a 1MB text payload into the "Hallowing the Meeting" section
    And Walker clicks the "Save" button for the "Hallowing the Meeting" section
    Then the app accepts the large payload and the UI remains responsive
    # Performance: large inputs should not block the UI or crash the app
